# Constant-Time

**Algorithmic Explanation of Constant Time Complexity (O(1))**

This repository provides explanations and examples related to **constant time complexity** in algorithms — specifically what it means for an operation to run in *O(1)* time and how to recognize or design constant-time algorithmic behavior.

## 📌 What Is Constant Time (O(1))?

In computer science, an algorithm or operation runs in **constant time** if the amount of time it takes to complete **does not depend on the size of the input**. That is, the execution time remains the same whether the input is small or large.

Example: Accessing an element in an array by index is typically O(1).

## 🚀 Key Concepts

- **Definition:** O(1) time complexity means execution time is bounded and **independent of input size**.
- **Examples:**
  - Reading a value from a fixed-index position in an array.
  - Assigning a value to a variable.
- **Non-Examples:**
  - Looping through input elements (e.g., O(n)).
  - Recursive calls that depend on input size.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Understanding constant-time behavior is crucial for designing **efficient algorithms**, especially in performance-sensitive areas like systems programming, cryptography, and real-time computing.
